# MCP Overview

## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for communication between AI models and external tools, resources, and services. This guide provides comprehensive best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining MCP servers.

## What is MCP?

MCP enables AI assistants to interact with external systems through a well-defined protocol, allowing them to:

- Access and manipulate data from various sources
- Execute tools and functions
- Provide contextual information to enhance AI responses
- Maintain secure and controlled interactions with external services

## Why MCP?

### Key Benefits

- **Standardization**: Consistent interface across all integrations
- **Security**: Built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Scalability**: Designed for distributed architectures
- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple transport protocols
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and logging capabilities

## Core Components

1. **MCP Servers**: Expose tools, resources, and prompts
2. **MCP Clients**: Connect to servers and utilize their capabilities
3. **MCP Gateway**: Central hub for managing multiple MCP servers
4. **Transport Layer**: Communication protocols (STDIO, HTTP, WebSocket)
