# MCP Best Practices Guide

!!! warning "Work in Progress"

## Welcome to the Model Context Protocol Best Practices Guide

This comprehensive guide provides best practices, patterns, and practical guidance for developing, deploying, and maintaining Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in production environments.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications—it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## What This Guide Covers

This guide is organized into practical sections that cover the entire MCP server lifecycle:

### 🧭 **Overview**
Start here for high-level concepts and decision points:
- [MCP at a Glance](overview/at-a-glance.md) — executive summary and checklists
- [Architecture](overview/architecture.md) — system design and components
- [Core Concepts](overview/core-concepts.md) — tools, resources, prompts
- [Standards](overview/standards.md) — protocol standards
- [Getting Started](overview/getting-started.md) — your first server
Get started with MCP fundamentals, architecture, and core concepts. Learn about the protocol standards and set up your first server.

### ⭐ **Best Practices**
Essential standards for robust MCP servers:

- [Architecture, Security & Operations](best-practice/architecture-security-ops.md)

### 💻 **Development**
Language-specific guides for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Go with real-world examples, patterns, and implementation details.

### 🧪 **Testing**
Comprehensive testing strategies including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches for MCP servers.

### 📦 **Packaging**
How to package and distribute MCP servers using language-specific package managers and container technologies.

### 🚀 **Deployment**
Deployment strategies for cloud platforms, on-premise environments, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

### ⚙️ **Operations**
Production operations including monitoring, logging, performance optimization, scaling, and incident response.

### 🔧 **Management**
Lifecycle management covering versioning, updates, rollbacks, and configuration management.

### 🛡️ **Security**
Security best practices including authentication, authorization, secrets management, and vulnerability scanning.

### 🔌 **Integration**
How to integrate MCP servers with Claude Desktop, gateways, and other AI applications and platforms.

### ❓ **FAQ**
Common questions, troubleshooting guides, and migration assistance.
