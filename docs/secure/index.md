# Secure

Security is a continuous discipline across design, build, deploy, and run. Combine platform-native controls with centralized governance.

## Principles
- Defense in depth with least privilege for tools and actions.
- Centralize policy where possible (gateway/proxy) to avoid re‑implementing controls.
- Treat authentication, authorization, and audit as first‑class requirements.

## Threats & Controls (High-Level)
- Input manipulation & injection: strict schemas, validation, and output sanitization.
- Over‑privilege & escalation: scoped tokens, approvals for high‑impact ops, runtime policy checks.
- Data leakage: data classification, minimization, redaction, and isolation.
- Supply chain risk: SBOMs, signing, provenance, trusted registries, vulnerability scanning.
- Drift & misconfiguration: baseline configs, policy-as-code, continuous posture checks.

## Identity & Access
- Granular scopes per tool/action; time‑limited, auditable credentials.
- Support OIDC/OAuth2 patterns as per spec; prefer mTLS between services.
- Record who/what/when/why with immutable audit trails.

## Runtime Protection
- Sandboxing (gVisor/Kata) and OS controls (seccomp, SELinux/AppArmor, cgroups).
- Network policy: least-privilege egress/ingress; mTLS; explicit allowlists.
- Circuit breakers and rate limits per tenant/tool; backoff with jitter.

## Monitoring & Response
- Dedicated security log stream; alerts for policy denials, unusual access, and data exfiltration patterns.
- Incident flow: detect → contain → investigate → remediate → recover → review.

## Compliance
- Align with organizational standards (SOC2/ISO/etc.); automate evidence capture.
- Apply continuous assurance, not point‑in‑time checks.

## Next Steps
- Centralize controls through a gateway/proxy where possible to avoid duplicating security logic across servers.
- Align with organizational compliance standards and document continuous assurance practices.
