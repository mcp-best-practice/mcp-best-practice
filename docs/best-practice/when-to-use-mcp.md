# When to Use MCP

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful tool for connecting AI applications with external systems, but it's not always the right solution. This guide helps you determine when MCP is the best choice for your use case.

## Ideal Use Cases for MCP

### üîå **Tool Integration**
Use MCP when you need to provide AI applications with executable functions:

- **Database Operations**: Query, insert, update database records
- **File System Access**: Read, write, search files and directories  
- **API Integrations**: Call external REST APIs, web services
- **System Commands**: Execute shell commands, system utilities
- **Custom Business Logic**: Domain-specific operations and workflows

**Example**: A customer service AI that can look up order information, update tickets, and send notifications.

### üìä **Contextual Data Access**
Use MCP when AI applications need access to rich contextual information:

- **Configuration Data**: Application settings, feature flags
- **Reference Information**: Documentation, knowledge bases, schemas
- **Real-time Data**: Status dashboards, metrics, live feeds
- **Historical Data**: Logs, analytics, audit trails
- **User-specific Data**: Preferences, history, personalized content

**Example**: A coding assistant that can access project documentation, code standards, and deployment configurations.

### üéØ **Prompt Templates**
Use MCP when you have reusable interaction patterns:

- **Domain-specific Prompts**: Industry or business-specific templates
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Complex interaction sequences
- **Few-shot Examples**: Standardized example sets
- **Role-based Prompts**: Different prompts for different user types
- **Parameterized Templates**: Dynamic prompts with variables

**Example**: A legal AI with templates for contract review, compliance checks, and document generation.

## When MCP Is the Right Choice

### ‚úÖ **You Should Use MCP When:**

#### **Standardization Matters**
- You want consistent integration patterns across multiple AI applications
- You're building for an ecosystem where interoperability is important
- You need to support multiple AI models or clients

#### **Security and Control Are Important**
- You need fine-grained access control to external resources
- You want to audit and monitor AI system interactions
- You need to implement rate limiting or usage quotas

#### **You Have Multiple Integrations**
- You're connecting AI to 3+ external systems
- Different teams will build and maintain different integrations
- You want to avoid tight coupling between AI and external systems

#### **Future Flexibility Is Valued**
- You might switch AI models or providers
- You want to reuse integrations across different applications
- You need to support both local and remote deployments

### ‚ùå **You Might Not Need MCP When:**

#### **Simple, Direct Integrations**
- Single AI application with 1-2 external systems
- Direct API calls are sufficient and straightforward
- No need for standardized patterns

#### **Prototype or Proof of Concept**
- Quick experimentation with AI capabilities
- Short-term projects with no long-term maintenance
- Learning or educational purposes

#### **Existing Integration Patterns**
- You already have robust, well-tested integration systems
- Significant investment in current architecture
- Current solution meets all requirements

## Decision Framework

### Questions to Ask

1. **Scale**: Will you have more than 2-3 external integrations?
2. **Reusability**: Will multiple AI applications use the same integrations?
3. **Longevity**: Is this a long-term, production system?
4. **Team Size**: Will multiple teams work on different integrations?
5. **Security**: Do you need granular access control and auditing?
6. **Flexibility**: Might you change AI models or deployment patterns?

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Direct Integration | MCP Integration |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Development Speed** | Fast (1-2 integrations) | Moderate setup, fast scaling |
| **Maintenance Overhead** | Low (simple cases) | Moderate but standardized |
| **Flexibility** | Low | High |
| **Reusability** | Low | High |
| **Standardization** | Low | High |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | Moderate |

## Common Patterns

### **Start Simple, Migrate to MCP**
Many successful projects start with direct integrations and migrate to MCP as they scale:

1. **Phase 1**: Direct API calls for initial functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Extract reusable components  
3. **Phase 3**: Implement MCP servers for standardization
4. **Phase 4**: Full MCP ecosystem with multiple servers

### **Hybrid Approaches**
You don't have to choose all-or-nothing:

- **Core Functions**: Use MCP for frequently used, standardized operations
- **Specialized Cases**: Direct integration for unique, one-off requirements
- **Legacy Systems**: Gradual migration as systems are updated

## Architecture Considerations

### **When MCP Adds Value**
- **Microservices Architecture**: MCP servers as service adapters
- **Multi-tenant Systems**: Shared MCP servers with tenant isolation  
- **Edge Deployments**: Local MCP servers for reduced latency
- **Compliance Environments**: Centralized audit and control

### **When Direct Integration Is Simpler**
- **Monolithic Applications**: Single codebase with embedded logic
- **Simple CRUD Operations**: Basic database or API interactions
- **Temporary Implementations**: Short-term or experimental features

## Migration Path

### **From Direct Integration to MCP**

1. **Identify Patterns**: Look for repeated integration code
2. **Extract Functions**: Create standalone functions for common operations
3. **Implement MCP Server**: Wrap functions in MCP protocol
4. **Gradual Migration**: Move one integration at a time
5. **Deprecate Direct Calls**: Remove old integration code

### **Migration Checklist**
- [ ] Document existing integrations and their usage patterns
- [ ] Identify common operations that could be standardized
- [ ] Create MCP servers for high-value integrations first
- [ ] Implement side-by-side testing
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy for each migration step
- [ ] Update documentation and team training

## Success Metrics

### **Indicators MCP Is Working Well**
- Reduced time to add new AI integrations
- Consistent patterns across different applications
- Easier testing and debugging of AI interactions
- Improved security and compliance posture
- Higher developer satisfaction with integration development

### **Warning Signs**
- MCP servers becoming overly complex or monolithic
- Significant performance overhead from protocol layer
- Team struggling with MCP concepts and implementation
- More time spent on MCP infrastructure than business value

## Conclusion

MCP shines when you need standardization, flexibility, and long-term maintainability for AI integrations. It's particularly valuable in:

- **Enterprise environments** with multiple AI applications
- **Teams building AI ecosystems** rather than single applications  
- **Organizations prioritizing security and auditability**
- **Projects expecting significant growth** in integration complexity

Choose MCP when the long-term benefits of standardization outweigh the initial learning curve and setup overhead. For simple, short-term, or highly specialized use cases, direct integration might be more appropriate.

Remember: you can always start simple and migrate to MCP as your needs evolve. The key is making an informed decision based on your specific context and requirements.
